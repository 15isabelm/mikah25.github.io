			"Excerpt": "The R32 trains, nicknamed the Brightliners for their shiny unpainted exteriors, were built to last 35 years. (Imagine that: Your lifespan stamped into metal, your death prefigured.)

			"Excerpt": "FROM TIME TO TIME I HAVE BEEN INVITed by institutions to speak about aesthetics. On one occasion I considered accepting and I thought of taking with me a bird made of white wood.
