                The illegal trade of ivory and animal horns is escalating 
                at an alarming rate - and going unnoticed. It can be hard to 
                grasp the scale and impact of wildlife crime when it feels so 
                far removed from daily life. But this isn’t just a distant crisis. It’s 
                deeply connected to the ways we value life, profit, and protection. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The story begins with the life of a single animal.

          <h2> The illegal trade of ivory and animal horns is a global problem. </h2>
          <br>

          <p> Wildlife traffickers rely on intricate webs of transportation routes and logistics networks to smuggle goods from their place of origin to consumer markets, sometimes in distant countries. </p>
          <p> Let’s take a look at some of these trade routes... ⤵</p>

          <br>
      <h2> Why is this still such a big problem?</h2>
      <p> While international legislation does appear to decrease horn and tusk trafficking, so long as a consumer market still exists for these products, the trade network will never be completely eradicated. These animals are still very much at risk.</p>
    
      <div class = "container">

          <p> 
            In the United States, one key piece of legislation was the Global Anti-Poaching Act. </p>
            <p>This 2015  law was designed to protect wildlife by strengthening wildlife enforcement networks, identifying key wildlife trafficking countries, and increasing penalties of wildlife trafficking to be equivalent with other trafficking forms.

      <br>
      <br>

      <h2> Despite legislation, border insecurities and corruption allow this trade to thrive.</h2>
      <p> 
        Major discrepancies between reported exports and imports, where imported quantities far exceed what exporting countries report, suggest a breakdown in trade oversight. These gaps point to potential smuggling, underreporting, and informal trade routes.

            You, too, could be an accidental consumer. 

            Carvings were the second most traded objects year over year.
            
            Rhino horns and other kinds of tusks come in forms like carvings, jewelry, and even antique cups or other houseware items.          </p>
